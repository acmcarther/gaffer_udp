# Gaffer UDP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acmcarther/gaffer_udp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acmcarther/gaffer_udp)

Based on [Gaffer on Games](http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/reliability-and-flow-control/) design

A rewrite of [game_udp](https://github.com/acmcarther/rust_game_udp), now that I'd like to think I can write Rust.

Uses my [Rust Cucumber](https://github.com/acmcarther/cucumber) implementation for integration tests.
